# Qbitos: Quantum Mechanics "On the rocks"

## Overview
This library is devoted to the experimentation with the mathematic operations and abstractions of the Quantum Computing and Quantum mechanics fields. It is not expected to be efficient or be part of any real-life system, but to provide some useful tools to study and understand some of the most typical Quantum Computing exercises.

This library uses its own Complex Matrix library, built from scratch, for learning purposes. Every comment on the library usage is appliable to this Math library as well.

The ide of the library is to provide:
* The most common mathematical functions used in Quantum Mechanics.
* A library with the most common operators and quantum gates.
* Some visualization features to show the results and intermediate numbers in a Dirac-like notation.

### A note about Complex Numbers
The Complex Numbers library used within Qbitos assumes that a Complex Number is a Clojure Vector of two real numbers, being the first the real part and the second one the imaginary part.

## Installation
This library is not distributed in any form apart from its Github Repository.

## Usage
In order to use it, copy the jar file in the appropriate folder and import it as usual.
